-Future Predictions
  With stable admission and discharge numbers over the years, the hospital can expect similar volumes in coming years unless there’s a major demographic shift or policy change.
  Chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension are likely to remain major drivers of hospital admissions, emphasizing the need for preventive care and effective long-term disease management programs.
  Medical costs per person may continue rising due to increased healthcare inflation and adoption of new medical technologies; cost-saving initiatives and value-based care could help manage expenses.
  Ageing of the population could lead to an increase in admissions for age-related illnesses, suggesting a need to strengthen geriatric services.
  The balance in gender and race demographics is likely to persist, but monitoring socio-demographic trends will be important for adapting care models.
  Improved patient satisfaction and lower readmission rates can be achieved by focusing on chronic disease management, patient follow-up, and enhanced care coordination.
 
-Predictive Analytics for Resource Planning
  Prediction: The high volume of diabetic patients (27,726) suggests a continued and growing demand for endocrinology services, insulin therapies, and diabetic complication management.

-Recommendation: Use this data to forecast future need for specialists, medication inventory, and educational programs focused on diabetes prevention and management.
 Reducing Readmission Rates
 Prediction: Without intervention, readmission rates for chronic conditions like Diabetes and Stroke will remain high, impacting hospital performance metrics and costs.
 Recommendation: Implement targeted post-discharge care programs for patients with chronic conditions. This could include follow-up calls, telehealth check-ins, and dedicated case managers to ensure medication adherence and lifestyle changes.

-Financial Forecasting and Cost Management
 Prediction: High-cost procedures (Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology) will continue to be the largest portion of the hospital's revenue and expense.
 Recommendation: Conduct a deep-dive cost analysis of these high-ticket departments. Explore ways to improve efficiency without compromising care. Predict future revenue streams based on the historical volume of these procedures.

-Enhancing the Dashboard for Deeper Insights
 To make the dashboard more powerful, consider adding the following analyses:
 Cost vs. Outcome Analysis: A visual showing if higher cost consistently leads to better outcomes.
 Readmission Risk Dashboard: A model that identifies patients at high risk of readmission based on their condition, age, and history.
 Trend Analysis Over Time: Instead of a static average, show how patient volume, costs, and conditions have changed year-over-year. This is crucial for accurate forecasting.
 Clarify Metrics: Fix the repeated "Avg Administered" metric and ensure all column headers are clear (e.g., "Length of Stay" instead of "Length of %").

-Growing Chronic Diseases
  Rising Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer cases → hospital should invest in chronic care units and preventive health programs.

-Cost Management
  With increasing patient inflow, average treatment cost may rise. Predict ~10–15% increase in next 5 years unless optimized.
  Suggest automation, preventive checkups, telemedicine to reduce costs.
